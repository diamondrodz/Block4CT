Section 1:Instructions
The first thing to my program is my program goals which talks 
about what is going to be happening in the program. The next thing 
is our loop that tells us what it’s going to say as soon as you click
 on the program underneath that is all the random things such as sorrt list,
 print list, random search, etc. And then everything underneath that is an
 elite shell and then under that is all the coding for the things I just mentioned



Section 2:Binary Search 
binary search is the computers way of talking… Sort of 
it uses numbers to communicate with us through the computer 
and give us the alphabet and teach us how to work with computers it’s 
like the computer sprain and a communicates with numbers


Section 3:Changes you made/want to make 

I could have got some help with the erres I got but
 i didn't ask for help. I also could have. my program 
could’ve been improved by the errors in the code some errors
 I couldn’t fix and I when I ask for help for because I was scared.
 Something specific that I could have changed in order to make my code  better is 
I could have added more coding to make it cooler
